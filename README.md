# Advanced C++ Projects

This repository contains a collection of advanced C++ projects developed as part of the SEP200 course. Each project focuses on different aspects of C++ programming, including operator overloading, deep and shallow copying, class inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and multiple inheritance. These projects collectively showcase the application of advanced C++ concepts in solving complex problems.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Bank Manager Operator Overloading (`BankManagerOperatorOverloading`)
This project demonstrates the use of operator overloading to manage investment accounts within a banking application. It includes the implementation of `==`, `+=`, and `-=` operators for account management.

### 2. Real Estate Management (`RealEstateManagement`)
A simulation of a real estate management system where deep and shallow copies, operator overloading, and friendship are explored to manage house objects effectively.

### 3. Amazon Purchase Simulator (`AmazonPurchaseSimulator`)
A program that simulates purchases from Amazon, showcasing the use of base and derived classes to handle different item types including books, DVDs, and digital music downloads.

### 4. Network Packet Parser (`NetworkPacketParser`)
This project involves parsing network packets using polymorphism and virtual functions, distinguishing between UDP and TCP packet formats.

### 5. Company Database Template (`CompanyDatabaseTemplate`)
An implementation of a company database using templates for parametric polymorphism, managing databases for regular employees and executives.

### 6. Sports Association Aggregator (`SportsAssociationAggregator`)
A demonstration of aggregation and enumerations to manage sports teams within a sports association, highlighting the use of overriding operators.

### 7. Cellphone Customer Database (`CellphoneCustomerDatabase`)
This project utilizes class variables, enumerations, and standard maps to manage a cellphone customer database efficiently.

### 8. Array Reorder Utility (`ArrayReorderUtility`)
A utility that reorders arrays using a custom stack and queue classes, alongside standard STL algorithms.

### 9. Car Ratings STL Algorithms (`CarRatingsSTLAlgorithms`)
An application of STL algorithms to process and analyze car ratings based on various metrics like reliability, fuel efficiency, and horse power.

### 10. Amphibious Vehicle Design (`AmphibiousVehicleDesign`)
A complex project that uses multiple inheritance to design an amphibious vehicle class, inheriting properties from both an automobile and a boat class.
